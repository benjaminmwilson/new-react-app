## Installation

After cloning the repo:

    npm install

## Starting

To start on localhost:

    npm start
    
The first time this is done it can take 10-15 seconds before 
http://localhost:8080/ can be accessed. 

## Building

To produce a production build:

    npm run build
    
To produce a development build:

    npm run dev
    
In both cases the output is placed in `dist`

## Static Files & Code

Static files such as HTML and CSS can be placed in `static`. They
will automatically be copied from here to `dist` at build time.

Code can be placed in `src` and `components`.
